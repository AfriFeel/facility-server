# Facility Server

A server to manage facility ressources, allow users to book ressources and request services.

## Installation

To run the server, only the latest LTS of `node` is required. If installed, open a terminal and run:

```
npm i
```

## Development

For development, you can run the server with file watching. This auto-restarts the server on file changes. To enable **watch mode**, run:

```
npm start
